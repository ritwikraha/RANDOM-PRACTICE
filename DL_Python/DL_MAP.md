# Courses:

As mentioned earlier, data science comprises many things and there are a lot of good resources on
the internet covering each and one of them. But the problem here is the resources are scattered
and for a beginner, it can be quite challenging to get hold of something that is suitable for him(s).
So, it will be a good idea for a beginner to begin with something that is well-accepted by the
community and something which has most of the things in place in a friendly way.

# Bonus!

If you are someone who is more comfortable with books then you can refer to ​this compilation by
FloydHub which does a pretty great job of enlisting all the books that are relevant for Data
Science and Machine Learning. Some of them are freely available and some of them come with a
little price.
